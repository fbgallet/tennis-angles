# Tennis Angle Theory Visualizer

An interactive web application that demonstrates and teaches Ren√© Cochet's revolutionary Tennis Angle Theory for optimal court positioning and defensive strategy.

## üéæ About the Tennis Angle Theory

Ren√© Cochet's Tennis Angle Theory is a fundamental strategic concept that revolutionized tennis positioning and shot selection. The theory demonstrates that the optimal defensive position on the court is determined by the angle bisector of your opponent's possible shots.

### Key Principles

- **Angle Bisector Positioning**: Position yourself on the angle bisector of your opponent's two most extreme possible shots to minimize court coverage
- **Equal Distance Strategy**: By positioning on the bisector, you ensure equal distance to defend against both cross-court and down-the-line shots
- **Court Geometry**: Understanding court angles allows you to anticipate and react more efficiently to your opponent's shots

## üî¨ Scientific Evidence

This theory is backed by scientific research published in Nature (February 2024): ["Henri Cochet's theory of angles in tennis (1933) reveals a new facet of anticipation"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53136-7). The study involving 23 professional players found that "the more experienced the players are, the more precise their application of this strategy becomes."
