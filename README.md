# Tennis angles simulator

Vibe coding experiment (my first big one) in React + Typescript, initialy using Windsurf AI + gpt-4.1, then switching to Cline + Claude Sonnet 4.

The idea is to simulate the theory of angles of Ren√© Cochet, easily visualizing where are the best placement and replacement positions.
