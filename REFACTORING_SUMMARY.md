# Tennis Court Component Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The original `TennisCourt.tsx` component was over 1000 lines long and handled multiple concerns. This refactoring breaks it down into smaller, more manageable modules following React best practices.

## Refactoring Structure

### 1. Constants and Types

- **`src/constants/tennis.ts`** - All tennis court dimensions, drawing constants, and configuration
- **`src/constants/court-images.ts`** - Court background image mappings
- **`src/types/tennis.ts`** - All TypeScript types and interfaces

### 2. Utility Functions

- **`src/utils/coordinates.ts`** - Pure coordinate transformation functions
- **`src/utils/geometry.ts`** - Mathematical calculations (angles, distances, bisectors)
- **`src/utils/tennis-logic.ts`** - Tennis-specific logic (swing resolution, shot calculations)

### 3. Custom Hooks

- **`src/hooks/useCourtState.ts`** - Player positions, shots, and court settings state management
- **`src/hooks/useDragHandling.ts`** - Drag and drop functionality
- **`src/hooks/useCanvasSize.ts`** - Canvas sizing and responsive behavior

### 4. UI Components

- **`src/components/CourtControls.tsx`** - All control panels and settings
- **`src/components/CourtCanvas.tsx`** - Canvas rendering component
- **`src/components/TennisCourtRefactored.tsx`** - Main refactored component

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **State Management**: Extracted to custom hooks
- **Business Logic**: Moved to utility functions
- **UI Components**: Split into focused, reusable components
- **Constants**: Centralized in dedicated files

### 2. React Best Practices

- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate complex state logic and side effects
- **Component Composition**: Break down large components into smaller ones
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Pure Functions**: Utility functions are side-effect free

### 3. Maintainability

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be reused
- **Testability**: Smaller functions and components are easier to test
- **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand

### 4. Removed Console Logs

- All `console.log` statements have been removed as requested
- Debug information is no longer cluttering the console

## File Structure Comparison

### Before (1 large file):

```
src/components/TennisCourt.tsx (1000+ lines)
```

### After (organized modules):

```
src/
├── constants/
│   ├── tennis.ts
│   └── court-images.ts
├── types/
│   └── tennis.ts
├── utils/
│   ├── coordinates.ts
│   ├── geometry.ts
│   └── tennis-logic.ts
├── hooks/
│   ├── useCourtState.ts
│   ├── useDragHandling.ts
│   └── useCanvasSize.ts
└── components/
    ├── CourtControls.tsx
    ├── CourtCanvas.tsx
    └── TennisCourtRefactored.tsx
```

## Preserved Functionality

All existing features have been preserved:

- ✅ Player positioning and movement
- ✅ Shot angle calculations
- ✅ Bisector visualization
- ✅ Optimal position calculations
- ✅ Court orientation switching
- ✅ Player handedness and swing settings
- ✅ Drag and drop interactions
- ✅ Touch/mobile support
- ✅ Statistics panel
- ✅ Game logic (position checking)
- ✅ All visual elements and styling

## Usage

To use the refactored component, simply import and use `TennisCourtRefactored`:

```tsx
import TennisCourtRefactored from "./components/TennisCourtRefactored";

function App() {
  return <TennisCourtRefactored />;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to specific functionality can be made in isolated modules
2. **Better Testing**: Individual functions and components can be unit tested
3. **Improved Readability**: Code is organized by concern and easier to navigate
4. **Enhanced Reusability**: Hooks and utilities can be reused in other components
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
6. **Performance**: Better separation allows for more targeted optimizations

The refactored code maintains 100% feature parity while being significantly more maintainable and following React best practices.
