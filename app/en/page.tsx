              <h2>Understanding the Angle Theory</h2>
              <p>
                Ren√© Cochet's Tennis Angle Theory is a fundamental strategic
                concept that revolutionized tennis positioning and shot
                selection. It provides a simple and effective method to
                reposition after each move, relying on geometric principles
                instead of guessing the opponent's intentions.
              </p>

              <div className={styles.keyPoints}>
                <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Angle Bisector Positioning:</strong> Position
                    yourself on the bisector of your opponent's two best
                    possible shots to minimize court coverage, no matter what
                    their next shot is.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Active defense strategy:</strong> By positioning
                    yourself on the bisector, you maintain an equal distance to
                    defend against cross shots and shots along the line, thus
                    preventing your opponent from having too much open space on
                    either side.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simplicity:</strong> In practice, you just need to
                    position yourself near the center of the court, on the
                    opposite side from your opponent when playing at the
                    baseline, and on the same side as your opponent when you are
                    close to the net.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className={styles.importance}>
                <h3>Why It Matters:</h3>
                <p>
                  Proper positioning based on angle theory can greatly improve
                  your defensive skills and court coverage. It increases your
                  chances of reaching any opponent's shot and frees your mind
                  from guessing their intentions, allowing you to focus on
                  what's actually happening in front of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even better, you know where to position yourself for your next
                  shot as soon as your intention for the previous shot is clear.
                  This way you have control to minimize your repositioning and
                  save your energy for the decisive shots.
                </p>

                <h3>Evidence-Based Theory:</h3>
                <p>
                  The Tennis Angle Theory is not just theoretical, it's backed
                  by scientific research. A recent study published in the
                  journal Nature established that among several possible
                  positioning strategies, it is indeed Angle Theory that best
                  describes the positioning of top players. In this study
                  involving 23 professional players among the world's best, it
                  "appears that the more experienced the players are, the more
                  precise their application of this strategy becomes."
